# Linux Sound Architecture


- [1] Excelent explanations about the motivations of running an audio server like PulseAudio or Jack. The video explains
  what ALSA is, and what other software PulseAudio, Jack and Pipepewire are. 

- [2] Information about the low level communication between ALSA and programs. There are some interesting
  questions at the end of the video (starting at 1:02:45)
    
  The information presented in this video is too low level to be useful for someone who wants to configure the
  audio on linux.
